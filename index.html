            Hi,my name is Himanshu Ranjan and I am a 3rd year CSE student. This
            year i have been selected as the representative for DSC in PES
            College of Engineering, Mandya . My job is to form the club with
            keen students who are willing to give time and passion to the
            program and to use the technologies available to them in order to
            gain industrial skills and at the same time solve problems by
            providing technology based solutions to the local as well as global
            community. We plan to make the most of the opportunities provided to
            us in order to grow as a developer and a problem solver which in the
            long run helps us as an individual and also contribute towards the
            society. Having said that, we would love for you to join us. You
            don't need to be skilled or knowledgable, just willing to give the
